The first thing we need to do for Fulcrum to work with Bitcoin Core is to enable transcation index in bitcoin.conf.

```bash
nano /media/ssd/bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```

There, add `txindex=1`, save and exit. Now, youâ€™ll need to restart bitcoind for it to take effect. The syncing will take quite some time to finish, you can check on its status by running:

```bash
tail -n 100 -f /media/ssd/bitcoin/debug.log | grep txindex
```
